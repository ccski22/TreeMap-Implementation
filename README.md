# TreeMap-Implementation
TreeMap in Java using linked cells, Map abstraction built on a binary search tree

One object (class) as "the TreeMap". The various MAP interface functions such as put, get, hasKey are called on that object. There is a field in the TreeMap object that is a link to the root data cell. If the field is null, then there are no nodes in the tree, and its size is 0. Recursion is used.
